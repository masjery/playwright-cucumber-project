# Playwright Cucumber E2E Automation Framework

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end automation framework built using Playwright and Cucumber (BDD).
It automates core user journeys on the SauceDemo website, including login, adding a product to the cart, and placing an order.
The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) structure for better code reusability and maintainability.
It is CI/CD ready and includes HTML reporting for all test executions.

## Tech Stack

Playwright – Browser automation
Cucumber (BDD) – Behavior-driven testing
JavaScript (Node.js) – Implementation language
cucumber-html-reporter – HTML reporting
Page Object Model (POM) – Code organization and reusability

## Features Automated

Login – Validates user login with correct credentials
Add to Cart – Adds selected products to the shopping cart
Place Order – Completes checkout and verifies confirmation message

## How to Run Tests

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Run all tests (headless mode off for visibility)
   npm test:report

3. View HTML Report
   After test execution, open:
   reports/cucumber_report.html

## Reporting

All feature results (Login, Add to Cart, Place Order) are combined in a single HTML report generated through the generateReport.js file.
The report includes test status, duration per step, and execution environment details.

## Future Enhancements

Add API-based authentication for faster login
Capture screenshots on failure
Integrate with CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins
